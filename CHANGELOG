CHANGELOG
=========

0.12.6: 2014-06-17
------------------

New features:
- Added `protocol_class` parameter for Pool and Connection
- Added experimental `HiRedisProtocol` class.

Fixes:
- Improving the performance of multibulk replies (Especially _asset, _asdict
  and _aslist methods should be significantly faster.)


0.12.5: 2014-06-03
------------------

Fixes:
- Circular reference between `Connection` and `Protocol` was never cleaned up
  because of __del__.
- Memory leaks in unit tests were fixed.

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Connection is not closed anymore in __del__, like in version 0.12.4, but
  instead the `Connection` and `Pool` classes got an explicit close method.


0.12.4: 2014-05-28
------------------

New features:
- Unix socket support. (When port=3, we suppose unix socket connection.)

Fixes:
- Closing of transport in Connection.__del__ and unittests.


0.12.3: 2014-04-18
------------------

Fixes:
- Correctly handle CancelledError.
- Passing of both host and port variables in unit tests.
- Using the correct loop during reconnect in Connection.


0.12.2: 2014-04-09
------------------

Fixes:
- Passing a custom loop should now work everywhere. (Unit tests added.)


0.12.1: 2014-04-03
------------------

New features:
- _asdict suffixes for methods that have a ZRangeReply return-annotation.
- Added ZREVRANGE

Fixes:
- Encoding of negative integers
- Fixes in the MOVE and PUNSUBSCRIBE
- Using separate logger
- Fix when transmitting large replies over the network.

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Iterating through a DictReply or ZRangeReply now yields futures that return
  (key, value) tuples instead of {key:value} dicts of one element. (This
  behaviour was not really documented and it certainly is an improvement.)

0.11.1: 2014-03-30
------------------

New features:
- Timeout support for blpop/brpop/brpoplpush
- setup.py improved. Don't install asyncio on Python 3.4


0.10.1: 2014-03-19
------------------
No changelog before this point.
