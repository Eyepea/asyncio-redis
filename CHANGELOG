CHANGELOG
=========

0.12.3: 2014-04-18
------------------

Fixes:
- Correctly handle CancelledError.
- Passing of both host and port variables in unit tests.
- Using the correct loop during reconnect in Connection.


0.12.2: 2014-04-09
------------------

Fixes:
- Passing a custom loop should now work everywhere. (Unit tests added.)


0.12.1: 2014-04-03
------------------

New features:
- _asdict suffixes for methods that have a ZRangeReply return-annotation.
- Added ZREVRANGE

Fixes:
- Encoding of negative integers
- Fixes in the MOVE and PUNSUBSCRIBE
- Using separate logger
- Fix when transmitting large replies over the network.

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Iterating through a DictReply or ZRangeReply now yields futures that return
  (key, value) tuples instead of {key:value} dicts of one element. (This
  behaviour was not really documented and it certainly is an improvement.)

0.11.1: 2014-03-30
------------------

New features:
- Timeout support for blpop/brpop/brpoplpush
- setup.py improved. Don't install asyncio on Python 3.4


0.10.1: 2014-03-19
------------------
No changelog before this point.
